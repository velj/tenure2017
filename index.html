                                  Dear Dr. Gray and Dr. Berryman, </br>
                                  </br>
Please accept this electronic portfolio as my official request to become a tenured faculty member. My experience teaching at McHenry County College has encouraged me to grow as an educator and as a professional in the field of early childhood education.</br>
</br>
These past few years have been rewarding, meaningful, and overall an amazing experience. I love being a faculty member at MCC, because I truly believe in the vision, mission, and philosophy of the college. Not only do I consider my work with students important, I also consider it valuable. My past teaching experiences and commitment to early childhood education provide me with a firm foundation to be an effective tenured faculty member.</br>
</br>
I consider myself a lifelong learner and I believe that my students encourage me to better myself every day. In the documents provided in my electronic portfolio, you will find evidence of my dedication to students and to the field of early childhood education. I have arranged this portfolio into the areas of subject matter, pedagogy, assessment, and professionalism. I have chosen documentation that I believe reflects my philosophy, as well as my commitment to the college.</br>
</br>
Sincerely,</br>
Melissa Veljasevic, M.S.</br>
Instructor of Early Childhood Education</br>

                                <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>
“Learning and teaching should not stand on opposite banks and just watch the river flow by;
instead, they should embark on a journey down the water. Through an active, reciprocal exchange,
teaching can strengthen learning to learn.”
</p>

<p align="left">
The above quote by Loris Malaguzzi summarizes my teaching philosophy. My philosophy reflects the idea that we are all lifelong learners, therefore, I prefer
 a classroom setting that encourages learning by both students and teachers. In order for learning to occur a teacher must create an environment that values
 mutual respect, acceptance of all strengths and weaknesses, and shared goals. While I set expectations high for my students, I am flexible in meeting their
 individual needs. I see the classroom as a community and we are all responsible for being productive members.
</p>

<p align="left">
To encourage students to be active participants in their learning, I prefer student-centered teaching strategies, which fosters intrinsic motivation and critical thinking.
Through the use of student-centered teaching strategies, I address multiple learning styles and encourage peer to peer learning through sharing experiences to engage in real
life connections. Students spend a fair amount of time in small groups and engaging in dialogue. Along with small groups, I use a combination of traditional lecture, multimedia,
 and application of knowledge into practice. I encourage students to ask questions and provide input in a safe non-judgmental environment to help drive instruction.
</p>

<p align="left">
I design a course that that allows me to learn about my students interests and utilize teaching strategies that maximizes those interests. I believe that students
 learn best from teachers who are enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I make myself available to my students and offer outside guidance when necessary. To measure student
 learning I may use all or a combination of some of the following assessments:

  In 2010, I was awarded the ECE Credential Level 5, which is for early care and education
  professionals who have formal education, training and experience with children (ages 0-
  8), either in the form of supervised observation or direct work experience. In addition to
  the ECE Level 5 Credential, I was also awarded the I/T Credential Level 5, which is for
  early care and education professionals who have specific training, education, and
  experience working with children birth to age 3. Recently, the ECE Level 6 and I/T Level
  6 Credentials have been created and I plan to expand my professional development hours
  to obtain those credentials.

    During my time at McHenry Community College, I have revised and adapted all assignments and syllabi to enhance student learning and success. I focused
     on adding lessons and assignments that reflect my belief of student-centered
      teaching and ensuring state standards were met.  I have also created expectations
       and assessments that reflect student needs based on student evaluations, such as
        utilizing canvas, lecture, hands on activities, in class group work, and
        reflections in all courses that I teach.
</p>
<p align="left" >
<strong>ECE 120:</strong> </br>Child Growth and Development is a foundation course. It is also a prerequisite for
 the majority of early childhood education (ECE) courses. The course addresses physical, cognitive,
  social and emotional areas of development from conception through adolescence and the interaction
   among developmental domains in the developing child.  Included in the course is a foundation of
   theory and research methodology and how they are related to an understanding of child development.
    I have designed this class to be taught in a unit format covering conception through birth, infants and toddlers,
    preschoolers, school-agers, and adolescence. This is beneficial for students because it follows a logical sequence
    and each unit builds upon the other. The main assignments in this class are an infant and toddler observation and
    a preschool observation. Both assignments now align with state competencies, accreditation, and credentials.
</p>

 <p align="left" >
   To ensure clarification of the course, I have included a course syllabus, assignment description,
 and a chart that shows which competencies and accreditation standards the preschool observation assignment meets.

<strong>ECE 219:</strong> </br>Early Childhood Science and Math is an activities course that covers the theory and practice
of teaching science and math to children from pre-kindergarten to  3rd grade.  It focuses on the creation
and evaluation of developmentally appropriate science and math activities and materials that encourage young
children to use their natural curiosity and interest in objects. Students participate in eight in class labs
where they test developmentally appropriate math and science activities and experiments for young children.
These labs are hands on and students complete a lab packet that requires them to reflect on ways they will
 prepare and teach children about the math and science concepts explored during the lab. When the course is
  concluded, students come away with a repertoire of science and math activities to hopefully implement
   into their future classroom.
</p>

<p align="left" >
  Again, to ensure clarification of the course, I have included a course syllabus, a lab packet,
   and pictures of students engaged in labs. I have obtained signed permission to use these
   photos in my portfolio from all of the students in these photos.

<p style="margin-bottom:-2px;"align="left">
Two strategies learned:
</p>
<ol  class="inline-block text-left">
  <li>Lisha had a guest speaker who presented about living with autism. Prior to his
arrival, Lisha discussed appropriate and inappropriate questions, which
she clearly had also done the previous class. She requested the students
write their questions down and she either approved them or encouraged
them to ask a different question. Her students knew exactly what was
expected of them.</li>
  <li>When the guest was finished, Lisha challenged her students to reflect on
the speakers’ experiences living with autism and the stigma in our society.
She also connected his responses to topics discussed in previous
classes.</li>

Future implementation of learned strategies:
</p>
<ol  class="inline-block text-left">
  <li>I appreciated the connections Sarah made to the textbook and I want
    to begin using mine in the same way. I often assume my students have completed
    the reading assignment and am quickly proven wrong when I ask them a
    question they should be able to answer.
  </li>
  <li>I plan to utilize canvas in a more meaningful way. I want to begin setting up

  I am a Certified Trainer for the Program for Infant and Toddler Care (PITC) and have
  been an ITN Trainer since 2014. ITN provides opportunities for early care and school-
  age practitioners and educators to pursue professional development through high quality
  and accessible trainings. All legally operating early child care and education and school-
  age programs in Illinois have access to ITN services. ITN trainings are scheduled through
  our local Child Care Resource &amp; Referral (CCR&amp;R) agency, 4-C: Community
  Coordinated Child Care. I presented these trainings for childcare providers living and
  working in McHenry County and DeKalb County. Below you will find a list of the

<p align="left">
  Audience: All Providers Caring for Infants, Toddlers and Twos</br>
  This first module begins with an overview of the basic concepts of early social-emotional
  growth and socialization and their application to the group care context. An emphasis is
  placed on the development of a nurturing relationship between the infant and caregiver.
  The overview addresses the importance of responsive caregiving, the individualization of
  care through an understanding of infant temperament, the critical role of family and
  culture in early identity development, and stages of emotional development.

  This training introduces special considerations in caring for infants and toddlers and six
  program policies that support the development of emotionally secure relationships in the
  group care setting. An overview of the content explores the positive impact of responsive
  caregiving routines, well-designed learning environments, and individualized care on the
  well-being and development of children from birth to three. Attention is given to how
  policies of primary care, small groups, continuity of care, individualization of care,
  culturally responsive care, and inclusive care of children with special needs provide the
  foundation for high quality infant/ toddler care.

<p align="left">
  Audience: All Providers Caring for Infants, Toddlers and Twos</br>
  This session introduces Module 3 by giving an overview of brain development, early
  learning, and appropriate curriculum planning for infants and toddlers. Participants watch
  the DVD &quot;The Next Step: Including the Infant in the Curriculum,&quot; which presents four
  domains of the infant’s curriculum: physical development, social relationships, language
  development, and intellectual development. The PITC’s view of infants as active, self-
  motivated learners is explained. The perspective that is presented can be summed up in
  the following way: “All children are born wired for feelings and ready to learn” when
  provided nurturing relationships and a peaceful but engaging environment. In addition to
  focusing on the infant’s curriculum, the DVD illustrates three strategies that infant care
  teachers can use to support early learning: adapt, support, and expand learning.

  Through viewing and discussing DVDs, personal reflection, and large and small group
  discussions, participants explore their cultural expectations and biases and have an
  opportunity to learn about alternative perspectives through the cultural lenses and
  experiences of others. Throughout these sessions, participants will increase their
  awareness of their own cultural assumptions and how these assumptions may affect their
  interaction with families from cultures different from their own. Participants will also
  explore the different emotions parents o en feel when bringing their infants to
  infant/toddler care programs. This type of exploration is designed to help participants
  increase their capacity for becoming culturally aware and responsive to families with
  children in infant/toddler care. provided.

<p align="left" >
  Over the past year, I have been working on embedding the Gateways State Credentials
  within ECE program. This will allow the ECE program to become an Entitled Institution,
  which means, ECE students will leave MCC not only with their certificates or degrees,
  but also with Gateways State Credentials. This is a critical piece in our states’ effort to
  develop a more unified approach to the early childhood workforce. The Illinois
  Community College Board, Illinois Department of Human Services, and both two- and
  four- year faculty from across the state were key partners in these efforts. To ensure our
  students will meet all of the required competencies to obtain their credentials, I have
  reviewed the courses we offer, made suggestions for changes in assignments and
  assessments, and am currently reviewing and revising the objectives in our core classes.
  This entitlement process will support our institutions’ efforts to enhance transfer options,
  as well as support students to completions of credentials and degrees. This process will
  be complete in the fall of 2018.

 Success </strong> </p>
<p align="left" >
  The focus of this project was to bring McHenry County College Early Childhood
  Education (ECE) faculty and high school partners together to identify and focus on ways
  to increase the likelihood that high school students will be able to complete the early
  childhood education pathways from high school through post-secondary school. This past
  summer we hosted a meeting of all McHenry County Family and Consumer Science high
  school teachers who teach child development courses. This meeting was planned to
  discuss ways to share information, specific to student demographics, the Gateways Level
  1 ECE Credential, and ECE content and coursework.

  As a professional in the field of early childhood education, I believe it is my responsibility to advocate
   for young children, their families, and the profession. I have done so by serving on statewide committees
    which promote early childhood issues, as well as participating in the writing of the Illinois Learning Guidelines.

    The Illinois Early Learning Guidelines for Children Birth to Age 3 provide early childhood professionals a framework for understanding child development by presenting information on what children know and should do and what development looks like in everyday life. The main goal of the Guidelines is to offer early childhood professionals a cohesive analysis of children’s development with common expectations and common language. These Guidelines also provide suggestions and ideas on how to create early experiences that benefit all children’s learning and development.

  As I participated in new faculty orientation, I discovered the value in video self-

  from this experience.

<strong>Strategies developed from the video-tape review and self-assessment:</strong>
</p>

<p align="left">
  While reflecting on my video-tape review, I noticed most of my students were engaged in
  their work. However, not all were. This assessment allowed me to observe myself from
  the students’ perspective and I noticed that my students would benefit from more active
  participation. This course is designed as a topics course, but I would like to offer more
  variety in my teaching strategies in order to connect the topics discussed in class to each
  other rather than focusing on them as separate entities. I would like to offer more
  opportunities for cooperative learning to encourage students to assume responsibility for
  their learning. I would also like to utilize technology and outside resources to connect
  course content to real-life situations to enhance students’ comprehension of content
  material. I would also enhance their comprehension by reiterating the main ideas of the
  lesson to conclude class, which I noticed I did not do. Therefore, I would like to
  incorporate such a discussion openly between the students and myself. By doing so it
  will help me identify what topics I need to discuss further.
</p>
<p align="left">
<strong>Results of implementation of strategies:</strong>
</p>

<p align="left">
  I noticed that after the students spent more time working cooperatively, they actively
participated in class discussion. They felt confident in their contributions and were able to
reflect on our discussion. By having the students summarize the main points of the class,
I have found that I am more aware of what they actually learned from that class. I can
also clarify things they don&#39;t quite understand and can connect it to the next class topic.
</p>

<p align="left">
<strong>Suggestions for improvement:</strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
  Through observation, I found that the same students actively participate, while others do
not contribute. To improve classroom engagement, I’d like to find new ways to help all
students to feel confident in the classroom. I want to work on my presentation of material
to involve both lecture and conversational teaching to help build classroom participation.
While I do believe I do both, I want to pay more attention to the needs of all students to
adapt as necessary. I also believe that discussing and showing more research will help the
students connect the content to field work.

<p align="left">
<strong> Strategies developed from the video-tape review and self-assessment: </strong>
</p>

<p align="left">
  This course is taught in a unit-type structure. I cover all stages of growth and
development from conception through adolescence. While reflecting on my video-tape
review, I realized that I started a new age group and the students were unable to connect
the theorists we discussed previously in class to the current age group being discussed. I
think it would’ve been beneficial to have done a more in-depth review of the previous
age group to give the students a clearer transition. I want to place the students in groups
and assign each group a domain of development for the age group we just completed and
they will then teach that information back to the class. I feel this will encourage them to
review and use their books, since most students do not complete the readings. This is
obvious to me, because I opened this class with a few questions regarding their assigned
reading and only three students raised their hands to answer. I also think that this activity
will allow me to interject when I notice the students are struggling with a topic.
</p>
<p align="left">
<strong>Results of implementation of strategies: </strong>
</p>

<p align="left">
  I noticed that after the students began participating in the teach backs, they were able to
  make more accurate connections to theories. I began adding more short-answer questions
  on my exams to see if the students knew how to apply the information they learned in
  class to real-life scenarios.
</p>

<p align="left">
<strong>Suggestions for improvement:</strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
  I want to continue to encourage my students to apply theory to practice. I think the best
  way to do this would be to add a reflection assignment to go along with their field
  observations. I will require the students to reflect on their observation experiences by
  connecting the children’s observed development to each of the theories we study.
